# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction Project  

This project is a Machine Learning application built to predict **customer churn**.  
It helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave, using historical customer data and a trained ML model.

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Customer information such as demographics, services used, and billing details are gathered.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded.  
3. **Model Training** – A machine learning model is trained on historical customer data to learn patterns of churn.  
4. **Model Evaluation** – The model is tested using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.  
5. **Model Deployment** – The trained model is saved (`.pkl` file) and integrated into an application (`app.py`) for real-time predictions.  
6. **Prediction** – Users can provide customer details in the app, and the system will predict whether the customer is likely to churn.
